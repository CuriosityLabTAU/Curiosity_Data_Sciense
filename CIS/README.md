In this work, We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for instance selection, called curious instance selection (CIS), 
which evaluates clusters of instances using the curiosity loop architecture. 
The output of the algorithm is a matrix that represents the value of adding a cluster of instances to existing instances. 
This matrix enables the computation of the Pareto front and demonstrates the ability to balance the noise and volume reduction objectives. 
This approach strengthens the appeal of using curiosity-based algorithms in data science.
