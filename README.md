# Curiosity_Data_Sciense
The goal of this research is Development of a single framework based on curiosity loop architecture for learning the data structures (feature and instance selection) in large and varied datasets. 
The repository currently include:
  1. Intrinsically motivated learning method for curious featrue selection (CFS) 
  2. Intrinsically motivated learning method for curious instance selection (CIS) 
  3. Scaling and generalization with deep learning architecture for curious featrue selection (DCFS)
